  description_less: MicroSim is a project under the National Supercomuting Mission, Govt. of India. It is a software stacks to allows to perform microstructure simulations using high performance computing using the phase field technique.

    <p>The software stack consists of phase-field codes that offer flexibility with discretization, models as well as the high-performance computing hardware(CPU/GPU) that they can execute on. Along with this the stack also consists of Multi-physics solver modules that are based on OpenFoam and AMRex libraries(will be added soon). The stack has an integrator interface that is built using python that allows one to create the input and filling files required for the solvers as well as provides a consolidated framework to choose the solver, compile, execute and visualize simulation results. The project is a consortium between (IISc Bangalore, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, Savitribai Phule Pune University, C-DAC Pune).</p>
